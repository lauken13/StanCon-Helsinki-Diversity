# StanCon-Helsinki-Diversity
During the StanCon Helsinki 2018 conference birds of a feather session, 6 members of the StanCon community met to discuss diversity challenges within the community. During this meeting the group discussed not only some of the challenges that the community faced, but also some potential solutions. In this report we (Lauren Kennedy, Muriel Lobier and Athanasia Mowinckel) will summarize the meeting, but note that as this was a discussion meeting, no one kept detailed notes. 

## Code of conduct  
Most conferences, including StanCon, have a clear code of conduct. 
Such codes makes it clear to attendees what type of behaviour is welcome (or unwelcome), and what the organizers may do if someone breaks this code.
Members of marginal groups are the most likely to be on the receiving end of unwanted behaviour, and thus having a clear CoC provides a clear indicating from the organizers that they will aid them should anything unwanted occur.

A clear CoC also aids community groups, like the Stan usergroup, in that members of marginal groups may feel more safe when engaging in the community, and thus it increases the probability of them actually engaging. 

## Scholarships to encourage diversity  

## Slack channel  

## Beginners space on discourse  

## Mentoring  

## Case examples
The Stan development team (and experienced users) have many different case examples of how to use Stan.
It may increase likelihood of engaging a more diverse user group if the examples featured data from different communities.
This could include data on gay marriage opinions before and after the marriage equality act, or using less Eurpoean and North-America centric data.
