# StanCon-Helsinki-Diversity
During the StanCon Helsinki 2018 conference birds of a feather session, 6 members of the StanCon community met to discuss diversity challenges within the community. During this meeting the group discussed not only some of the challenges that the community faced, but also some potential solutions. In this report we (Lauren Kennedy, Muriel Lobier and Athanasia Mowinckel) will summarize the meeting, but note that as this was a discussion meeting, no one kept detailed notes. 

## Code of conduct  
Most conferences, including StanCon, have a clear code of conduct. 
Such codes makes it clear to attendees what type of behaviour is welcome (or unwelcome), and what the organizers may do if someone breaks this code.
Members of marginal groups are the most likely to be on the receiving end of unwanted behaviour, and thus having a clear CoC provides a clear indicating from the organizers that they will aid them should anything unwanted occur.

A clear CoC also aids community groups, like the Stan usergroup, in that members of marginal groups may feel more safe when engaging in the community, and thus it increases the probability of them actually engaging. We discussed creating an overarching CoC that encompasses all of the Stan community, including discourse etc.

## Scholarships  

We breifly spoke of the importance of scholarships to aid those for whom attending conferences causes a greater financial burden, and discussed the complexity of administering these scholarships. 

## Slack channel  

Suggestion of greater utilization of the Stan slack channel, especially with some monitoring from more advanced users. 

## Beginners space on discourse  
Stan Forums via Discourse (and archived gmail mailing list) is a excellent resource for statistic techniques and Stan techniques more specifically. However, the content of these threads often represent the challenges faced by more experienced users. We discussed that this can make asking a simple or beginner question on discourse feel quite intimidating, even if the likely responses are friendly and helpful. We thought that it might be helpful to include have a specific thread on Discourse for beginners who are just getting started. 

## Mentoring  

Suggested programs of mentoring both from a user and developer perspective. 

## Case examples
The Stan development team (and experienced users) have many different case examples of how to use Stan.
It may increase likelihood of engaging a more diverse user group if the examples featured data from different communities.
This could include data on gay marriage opinions before and after the marriage equality act, or using less Eurpoean and North-America centric data.
